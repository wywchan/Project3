0,from my understating humans originated from africa and the reason we look different is from how we evolved in different areas if this is true how is it possible to tell from samples of our blood saliva what race we are and where our ancestors are from does dna really show the demonym of our ancestors how so this is all considering that it s commonly being taught that there is no such thing as race based on how we evolved and where we are from would it be safe to assume ancestry tests are a scam,if humans originated from the same place how can we tell our race by our dna
0,so i m dealing with quite a number of agencies at the moment which require a lot of administrative work a lot of these agencies are coming back to me with apologies for things taking so long because the number of their staff are working from home now to me this is a little bit confusing because i ve been to a number of these officers and their people don t actually have a physical component to their job they do everything electronically anyway and in fact to deal with a lot of these organisations i have since had to go completely electronic on my end as well in order to make their processes more efficient which i had no problems with because it worked for me as well so i m curious as to hell the physical location of the employee actually affects their productivity if their job was entirely computer based to begin with i mean computers don t really care where they re located in the world be that in an office building on top of mount everest or sitting at home office or on the dinner table we ve had telephones for over years now allowing voice communication and interaction without physical contact and we have had email since the s plus now services such as verisign i mean that you don t even need to have physical printed copies of documents in order to have them signed and a lot of organisations already have their own encryption and digital certificates for internal correspondence around the department s allowing them to digitally sign anything that is used within their organisation now i know that when you re at home office you re not within the organisation but isn t that the point of vpns a vpn is supposed to make the service think that your computer is physically located within their infrastructure so what exactly is going on that is making these people less efficient as soon as they get home and are they being docked pay for the loss of efficiency when they re at home especially if their job involves meeting kpi s and servicing deliverables the type of job where you are paid as a result of the output of your work rather than gross hours logged in the office,why is working from home being used as an excuse for jobs that were already entirely online

0,three days ago i m sitting in my living room playing tormentor x punisher with the sound nearly muted i was capturing video and left my mic plugged in didn t want feedback so it was dead quiet in my place while i sat there making no more noise than the clicks on my steam controller throttles suddenly i hear a tremendous pounding above me the neighbor is jumping up and down on the floor and ramming his heels after seconds of that then a second pause the noise resumed in what i can only describe as the sounds of fists pounding a boxing speed bag but it was his fists pounding the floor another insane outburst this is nothing new but as usual i sit there baffled trying to understand what argument this man is having in his head that would explain this later i m outside having a small cigar and he confronts me and starts yelling counter yelling occurs he looks like he hasn t slept in a week and got hit by a steamroller and flees in his car police are called another time i heard the sounds of pitter patter in the bathroom it was am and i staggered out of bed and through the dark flipped on the blinding light and saw that water was pouring out of the ceiling i desperately moved storage bins to capture the water as it flowed long story short it stopped on it s own after about minutes management entered his suite am the next day when he was away and found the tub full still to the brim with water everywhere in the bathroom and already flowing into his hallway the first really bad incident occurred when i was having my brother over for roasted potatoes and coffee in the late morning and mr upstairs neighbor starts pounding on my door with a roofing hammer i disarmed and badly scarred him police were called the first time of the three times i ve had to call the police on this man he rearranges his furniture every days he waits until am to do this good things can come from bad events and through the confrontation described in the first paragraph i ended up getting to know neighbors in other suites in the varied conversations that flowed i came to find out that he abuses them in similar ways they report that he makes noise all day and night which comes through his door and echos into the hall they tell me about random outbursts where suddenly somebody will pound on their door with what sounds like a hammer fist punch and nobody s there when they work up the courage to peer through the eye hole i hear strange coughing from above me when he s home it only happens periodically and by that i mean every hours or so its some kind of high pitched squeaky cough that sounds like a blend of a cough and a sneeze it literally sounds like a choo or a tsew but in a high pitch ok so i m thinking this man is enjoying some kind of mood altering substance and whether i m right or wrong about that and of course this is up for discussion and i m feeling like this use is tied to the outbursts i m describing which all seem so arbitrary and explosively random so given what i ve said about his behavior and the sounds i m hearing what do you think is going on with this man,serious question what is wrong with this man what is my upstairs neighbor doing meth what are the sounds of chirpy coughing i hear which seem to precede noise outbursts and once he attacked my door with a hammer neighbors say he pounds on their doors randomly and other insane harassment

1,growing up i was a very happy go lucky kid i loved being the center of attention yet i was and still am extremely shy being born months premature i was smaller than all the other kids my age i don t remember being bullied except for just once but my mom has said that i harbored no i ll will towards them fast forward to when i was my grandmother from egypt i m mixed came to visit us here in the united states my mom and i didn t know it at the time but my grandmother and possibly father i don t know has narcissistic personality disorder and my grandmother is extremely good at manipulating most of her children as she spent more time with us my grandmother started tearing my dad from my mother and me and demanding his full attention she convinced him that my mom and i were evil and that we were corrupting him i remember one night my grandmother walked up to my mom grabbed her own tits and said he suckled from my tits i ve let you have him long enough now i m taking him back she was so manipulative that i wanted to give her a taste of her own medicine this was just as much a cry for help as it was an attempt to ge back at her but i took a kitchen knife and gestured at slitting my throat i was years old and i was also very manipulative or attempted to be of her we fed off of one another it was like a sibling rivalry for the attention of the parent i believe she is mentally stuck at the age of due to trauma long story short she ran away from our house in the middle of the night coaxing my dad to run after her after that incident he left the house to go live with her in an apartment to give you some background on my grandmother she comes from the boonies of southern egypt where things are very archaic and rooted in tribal tradition her parents died young and her older brother was now newly in charge of her and her older sister my grandmother is the baby of the family she is a very intelligent woman even if at times she would have you think otherwise my grandmother loved school and wanted to become a teacher but at she married my grandfather who was years older and had to drop out of school leaving all her friend behind in order to he with him her marriage to my grandfather was arranged by her brother to get her out of the house one less mouth to feed i don t know the specifics but he left her to live on his own sometime during my father s upbringing he is one of siblings it s interesting both my mom and i have noticed that the soft spoken and reserved siblings went to live with him who was also very much reserved the extroverted kids stayed with her now i believe that him leaving affected my grandmother one way or another my father looks identical to my grandfather when he was younger i have noticed that he fills a perverted replacement husband type role in his relationship with my grandmother very codependent i was at the apartment with my grandmother my father was at work and she was talking on skype with her kids i kept interrupting her on purpose understandably she was pissed she grabbed a butcher knife from the kitchen and tried to harm me i looked into her eyes and all i saw was a complete and utter absence of emotion contrast this to when her eyes were shining with joy as she played my father for a fool i ran out of the apartment and called my mom long story short there was a warrant for her arrest but she secretly fled the country before the police could catch her this was when i was my concept of what a grandma could be was forever warped i m lucky to have had a very loving and genuinely sweet grandmother on my mother s side all throughout nd to th grade my grades dropped terribly and i started pushing everyone in my grade away from me in a futile attempt to cope i have always been extremely good at analyzing people and knowing what buttons o push to get what i want from them i wanted my classmates to despise me so i began to learn each kid s week spots and vulnerable areas i love manipulating people i always have my mom was extremely concerned since one night i had told her that i wanted to die throughout this whole ordeal from age to i never cried i was emotionally numb summer of sophomore year going into junior year i started to spiral things had been going pretty well i had been recovering from the divorce rather well or so it seemed some things had been building in the background and they were all coming to a boil my mom always bragged about how i was such a good kid at an age where other kids were acting out and then things changed i don t completely understand why it happened when it did but i changed completely i started verbally abusing her breaking things in the house stealing from her etc this all culminated one night when i came home from work i was tired and i wanted to turn to one of my long time escapes in videogames we had argued on the way home and so she said that i wasn t allowed to have them i dared her to make me turn them off she went to go unplug my ps and i told her do you want me to go get the knife this completely broke her she was in utter shock screaming oh my god oh my god i can t believe my son just said that to me why why god she broke down trembling and in tears i voluntarily admitted myself to a mental hospital since it meant getting out of school and getting on medication however once i got out things were back to the same old thing a couple of weeks later my mom and i were in another arguement i don t remember the specifics but i said you know i can kill you at this point even if she were afraid you couldn t tell it she dared me saying i might as well get it over with she said i wasn t her son then she said something that hit me she said i see evil in your eyes you are the devil this made me overjoyed i kept staring at her and i started to grin i went up to the upstairs mirror and looked my eyes were black no light reflected in them complete and utter nothingness i have always had very low self esteem since i was however i have always been in love with myself i dichotomy that doesn t make sense i stand looking in the mirror nitpicking my faults them immediately pick out my good qualities and focus on them it used to be upwards of an hour sometimes but has significantly improved as time has gone on i am much more stable now thank god i m on additional medication and i feel and act much better however i have always loved acting ever since i was a toddler i loved i dress up and act i am extremely detail oriented when it comes to people their body language voice etc but one point has always been an obsession of mine people s eyes i can t tell you how man times i have been caught staring intensely a someone drinking in their appearance i have always loved imitating actors i would say i m relatively in tune with my body i know how to change my eyelid shape the distance of my gaze e g thousand yard gaze to intense focus i get so caught up in acting and playing a part that it is second nature to me i feel as though many of my actions i just mime the reason for the title is for the simple reason that i don t want to believe i am a narcissist i ve always despised the idea of narcissism in other people i want to believe that i am a selfless and kind person right now due to meds i am at a baseline meh i ponder these thoughts more than i used to when i was at my worst due to the coronavirus i have a lot of time to myself in the bathroom mirror i wanted to take some pictures to post on instagram so i smiled and snapped away then i decided you know what i ve never seen my thousand yard stare from a distance why not take a mirror selfie of it i don t know why but when i went to go look at the picture it shocked me see i m constantly at war with myself there is the humble kind me and there is the selfish and self worshipping side of me i don t know which is more real than the other the picture of my stare epitomizes everything my negative half is again i don t know why but it scared me looking into those eyes i couldn t believe that was me but at the same time that same morbid joy stirred inside of me writhing in happiness i am afraid of those eyes and what those eyes are capable of i posted the picture to various social media and people were disgusted and scared some of my friends said that i syare at them with those eyes i don t even mean to many times i don t know how to feel about my eyes since they are a part of me that i both enjoy and despise i know this was a long post and i apologize i don t know if i m posting this to the right subreddit but i want another perspective i can t find any solid research on this i don t know if this is possible i don t even know if i am narcissistic my psychiatrist is unable to diagnose me i m just very curious any response would be greatly appreciated i ll post a link in a separate post the link is to photos one of my smiling with a glint in my eye and one of my dead stare my eyes http imgur com gallery p cmwug,is a narcissist in denial even possible

1,i ve f been dating s o f for months i should preface this post by mentioning things have moved rather quickly from the jump we haven t exactly defined the relationship but are seeing each other exclusively i think we share the realization that what we have together has great potential at a month of dating we went to a couple of large gatherings sporting events the first week of march obviously this was before everyone understood what covid would do to the u s and before everyone was practicing social distancing and implementing other safety precautions i fell sick with flu like symptoms the tuesday following our outing my fever had subsided within two days but i went to the doctor anyway thinking it was the responsible thing to do i was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection likely viral but was not tested for anything there were no tests for covid available at the time the doctor cleared me to go back to work contingent upon whether the fever came back i went back to work the next day and she and i spent that weekend together as the virus got more serious and everything had begun to cancel we both agreed that we may have been infected she commenced a two week quarantine completely isolated i self isolated to the best of my ability as i was and am still having to go into the office we have had a contact policy for weeks now and i have very little interaction with the two other employees we figured it would be safe to see each other after this period it was extremely difficult grueling even for me to be physically apart from her as we hadn t gone more than days without seeing each other so this past weekend and a couple of nights this week i stayed with her reunited and it felt so good but today things took a dramatically sharp turn i do live with my family sister and parents right now yesterday my step dad suggested i should pick a place to quarantine home or s o s place until april th our state mandated a stay at home order effective today i did not nor do i understand the logic as she has had no other contact but me in weeks i haven t had any exposure with anyone aside from her my direct family and two co workers since march th in bringing it up to her we both initially thought it ridiculous and i told her i would speak to my mother about the situation fast forward to this morning i asked my mom her thoughts on my step dad s comment she also thought it ridiculous because she knew how careful s o and i have been my mom and stepdad talked about it last night i immediately call s o with the news thinking she would be happy that we needn t suffer through another quarantine apart she informed me that she thought more about it determining we should quarantine apart again and admitted she thought it reckless that we saw each other this weekend i m destroyed and feel as if this came out of nowhere if i hadn t brought it to her attention we would be spending this weekend together so my questions are were we irresponsible in seeing each other at all after only months is it feasible we sustain the relationship without realistically knowing when we ll see each other again i m not one for long distance but i don t want to lose her am i being completely selfish help please feels like i ve been gut punched,new partner now thinks we were reckless after seeing each other over the weekend despite both of us quarantining for weeks prior i am outraged am i being irresponsible selfish

1,for context i live in ma we have pretty generous unemployment benefits to begin with and now with the additional week you can make the equivalent of k year on unemployment i looked at the latest unemployment stats and healthcare workers are one of the largest groups with jobless claims after food and hospitality understandably many primary care doctors specialists and surgeons are canceling routine check ups and elective procedures right now so those who aren t in emergency medicine and other key departments are being furloughed but won t we need more healthcare professionals as this virus continues to escalate and why would nurses and nps respiratory therapists lab techs etc want to go back to work in a large hospital and put themselves at risk of infection when they can make roughly the same or more on unemployment even if we offered hazard pay how many would take that chance i m sure some practitioners feel a moral obligation to help fight the virus but others will understandably put their family s well being and or financial interests first i m glad the cares act passed because millions of americans desperately need financial support and would go bankrupt otherwise but i m concerned that juicing up unemployment benefits particularly in states with generous ui to begin with will make it harder to fill the roles we need most desperately in a pandemic the same goes for things like gig workers who deliver groceries medication etc but i ve kept this post focused on nurses for simplicity curious to hear other perspectives on this especially if you are a furloughed medical professional,will nurses go back to work treating covid patients if they can make more money on unemployment

1,hi not sure if this fits in here but i definitely want to get some opinion on this i also posted this in r recruitinghell this is mainly directed towards people in companies that do a lot of college recruitment for internships and jobs but any response is welcome i m a freshman student majoring in business and at my university they have a regular program and a honors program for my major unfortunately i did not get into the honors program but i know of people who are in it and they are constantly talking about how recruiters absolutely go head over heels for honors students and that basically the regular students are just fed the leftovers and made to fight over them i ve gotten offers for internships but i can t help but wonder if what they said is true i d like some outside perspective since both me and them are bias in some way do employers tend to value honors students a lot more than regular plan students or is it more or less a title or formality that doesn t really matter in the long run if there is that much of a huge gap in employer interest what can i do to kind of make myself more like able in that sense thanks for reading,question for employers college recruiting for honors students vs regular plan students like me
1,i have learned of a hidden defense mechanism within me that i will call tommy tommy is a good guy he means well but sometimes he feels attacked by something that isn t directed at him at all and begins to attempt to defend me by attacking back all inside my head of course not out loud an example of this would be when someone is talking about their experience of sexual harassment online the line sexist men have done this and this will trigger tommy as i am a male tommy feels that the word sexist is being applied to all men thus the first reaction tommy gives me is to act defensive against this person after further analysis of course this defense is completely unwarranted it could be said that the wording in that sentence could be improved but the truth is that it usually is men who do these things i know full and well what this person is trying to say but i act defensive regardless another example would be in school when our teacher tells us that cell phones have severe intellectual repercussions for the youth of today tommy knows that i like my cell phone and do not like being called dumb and automatically takes the opposite stance of the debate technology has done so much for us he says it is a narrow mindset to look at only the negative aspects of it but once again this is unwarranted my teacher never denied that cell phones had positive impacts on society she was simply stating the fact that there are negative ones that we should look at tommy was far too aggravated to see clearly that i even agree with the point my teacher made now to blame the parents for poorly mandating their children s behaviors or the corporations for selling it to them is a completely different debate but for me to so actively oppose my teacher s original statement is a poor stance on my part now that i have realized that tommy exists i will make sure to mitigate his effect on my values if you have a tommy as well i hope that you can take something away from my rant thank you for coming to my ted talk,do you guys ever react negatively to a fairly made point just because you re taking it too personally

1,people constantly make fun of white people cooking for not using seasonings people dump hot sauce on their food to add flavor people in an askreddit thread are gagging at the idea of anyone enjoying a simple baked salmon with lemon but wouldn t this mean that those who use minimal spices actually do enjoy the taste of their food otherwise they d add more to it any time i eat something super spicy or smothered in sauces i feel like you re just covering up the actual taste of the food why is there something wrong with me liking the taste of steamed broccoli without having to cover it in cheese sauce did all these spicy food lovers just burn their taste buds off because plenty of food tastes great as is,why is it that not smothering your food in spices or sauces means you hate food or don t have taste buds
1,and i almost forgot i also hate it when i am watching a good movie with other people and they keep checking their phone,is it strange that i can not enjoy a movie or even watch a tv serie if it s not dark outside i dim the lights and mostly just turn them off when i am with more people in the room i can t wait untill they leave so i can watch alone
1,i am assuming it is because it would cause troubles with their development but i can t point the finger exactly as to why also it s like this in pretty much every culture throughout history so there must be a very good reason for it or has this something to do with protecting them from pedophiles and i am just not seeing it,why do we shield our kids from sexual imagery and full sex education until they reach a certain age
1,im not sure if this makes sense i was thinking about it recently throughout history we ve noticed how people have forcefully changed others cultures traditions and religions for the sake of making them more european or american or whoever was off on their conquest today it doesnt happen to the same extent but i still notice this kind of mentality out there like latin americans with smashing your face in someones birthday cake its a really minor tradition but whenever i see it i see a bunch of people complaining about it and asking it to die off as though americans for example arent wasting a fuckton of food every year here s where it gets more controversial though then there s more extreme examples such as rooster fighting or even more so bullfighting i grew up frequently visiting my grandparents who were raised in the rural countryside of ecuador and my grandfather is a cockfighter it s his hobby cause well there isnt anything to do in the middle of nowhere other than milk cattle sleep in a hammock and eat i wonder though what kind of changes in lifestyle would these pueblos have to go through so that they dont have to turn to what technically is animal abuse for entertainment would they still be the same culture would they be more americanized or european i dont know of this makes sense like to what extent should we change norms to what other cultures think is right or isnt right same with the food people eat people who might eat pet animals or insects theres people who think its outlandish or wrong does this make sense to what points should traditions change in order to make things right does that make the culture more like the others i mean since i brought in bullfighting and cockfighting i figure itll be controversial but thats why im in this sub in it,where do we draw the line between changing someone else s culture because something isnt ok and letting people have their traditions

1,i feel i already know the conclusion to this i m just not the guy when it comes to arranging social plans or i m reading into examples of the titled scenario more often than i should but the text etiquette i grew up with is as follows interchange until all loose ends have been tied i never tied myself in a knot if people took a day or two that s what texts are for this seemed to last throughout my teens and die once i reached adulthood maybe it s just how i was raised but when you start a conversation the other person doesn t ignore you the most obvious excuse for failing to communicate completely is you d assume that person has been busy in their adult life seen the message on their watch and forgotten to reply or whatever i wouldn t care to count the number of times i ve had to bump my solo group messages this year alone and i have never mentioned it to anyone who s done this i think to do so would be to seek clarification that i m driving people away with my personality and i m worried i might even get it whether i m liked that way or not i just find it fucking rude i thought about you enough to invite you to my house and cook or out for a beer and you re either busy or you don t want to either way there are people who don t even deign to say sorry dude some other time it s been a pretty consistent or so years of this i m thinking either half of my friends are shitty or i am there s a marginal chance i misunderstand the nature of adults texting but i don t think so,is ignoring a text whatsapp the new i m busy that night

1,i know that this may sound like a stupid question for a lot of people but please let me explain i never had a place to clean my family and i used to live in my grandmother s house during my entire childhood and she was a control freak she would never let anyone clean her house wash a dish or do anything that evolved cleaning she would always say that we didn t know how to do it so she would just kick us out and clean everything herself we couldn t even watch it to learn how she did it and which products she used all we knew is that she could clean it perfectly and it would only take her or hours of her day to clean a floor house when i became a teenager we moved to an apart hotel and again we couldn t clean it there was cleaning ladies that would clean the room everyday so again i spent my entire teenage and young adult life never cleaning anything i told this to my friends a few times to ask how should i clean a house and they just mocked me and joke with things like i was spoiled or poor little rich girl that made me feel really embarrassed so i stopped asking when i finally was able to rent my own place i asked a friend to help me clean it and she thought me a little but i was amazed of how quickly she would clean the floor and how much i was lacking some basic life skills i tried to clean my house alone a few times of course and it would always took me hours to clean a one bedroom apartment i have no idea what am i doing wrong and how to improve my cleaning skills i want to be able to clean the house in hour like my friends do but no matter how hard i try feels like i can t get it right and now i feel i m to old to ask for help so i decided to seek for help here is there any tutorials or any tips on how can i do that better,how to effectively clean the house

1,i m sorry if this comes across as insensitive or cruel but i ve been thinking on it and wondering why it hasn t seriously been considered yet as far as i can tell if the vast majority of people who are actually in danger of being severely affected or killed by covid are elderly immunocompromised or otherwise ill people then why don t only they self quarantine why go to the trouble of shutting down the whole economy and forcing people to lose their jobs if most of those people likely would be fine if they got sick that way we could build a herd immunity i m probably missing something so if someone could enlighten me that would be great,why don t we just have vulnerable populations self quarantine

1,i m coming off r amitheasshole as i write this of particular note are two threads one about a former addict asking if he s in the wrong for not wanting his brother to write and publish a book about op s addiction and how it impacted the people around him and another about the father of a bulimic son whose wife won t stop treating their son like he s always purging when he goes to the bathroom i know medically that addiction and other mental illnesses can change people even after successful treatment both physically and mentally you ll never be able to trust an alcoholic alone around alcohol because well they ve demonstrated a tendency to abuse it but in the case of the addict on aita there was a noticeably stark divide between the large group who seemed to despise the op for even suggesting he didn t want the story he shares with his brother made public because he was an addict and it s his just punishment for the harm he caused the therapeutic benefits to his brother seemed largely incidental to them and the people who supported op in his desire to keep the details of his addiction private and yet overwhelmingly people seemed to support the father of the bulimic in chastising his wife for treating their son well like a bulimic if there were any comments to the contrary they were buried beneath a mountain of voices calling for the father to make his son feel normal again when does it change when do people stop being addicts and start being people who were addicts is this a double standard we hold for drug abusers versus people with other arguably equally harmful mental illnesses or is it just common knowledge i m missing that an addict will always be an addict no matter what they do or demonstrate to the contrary and we can t ever treat with them like we would people who never experienced their addiction i ask because under normal circumstances i don t think those commenters would profess the opinions they do a person has a right to privacy according to them an addict does not is the addict then somehow different from a normal person to such an extent that we may excise fundamental rights from them and if we can permit that at least while an addict is in the throes of their addiction when do they get to be human again,are addicts ever allowed to be normal again

1,so i am deeply afraid of death i m and so maybe it s my lack of experience but i can t help but feel like i ll never be ready to go or even worse watch the people around me go with this in mind i ve noticed that a lot of the older folks like s s but more in the upper half seem like they re not scared of death or are morbidly awaiting it i m under the impression that maybe with late friends and family as you age maybe pains and health problems as well is a reason why these people feel the way they do but to me even with those reasons it s not easy to rationalize the concept of me or my friends not being here anymore i can t make peace with it and it feels like i never will something that i recently realized was that before my grandma passed basically my mom when i was just about to turn was that she would cry a lot by herself she was a very sweet and genuine human being i ve never had support like hers in my life but looking back she was really sad and would always talk about how she misses her mom and how soon it d be her time it was like there was no way to stop the sadness and me being dumb as hell didn t even realize that s besides the point but i guess it s just to point out one case in my life also in the last years or so i ve gotten really close to my bfs grandma she only speaks spanish and lives in a home with one other spanish speaker out of the people living there i speak spanish as well so we were able to bond super well but with that came her confiding in me with her current situation and feelings she would tell me about all the pain she s in and quite literally tell me that she s been praying for god to take her it s both extremely sad and seriously disheartening another part of me thinks that because at least in the last two instances i ve mentioned they were both religious maybe they had that to fall back on like a sense of hope was given to them in contrast to me who is more doubtful on that subject i would love to hear if anyone else has been there with this or is there i m super empathetic and this shit seriously fucks with me,i m afraid of death but all the way older people around me seem to be ready for it to come is it possible that people become ready to die with age
1,i am finding myself more often with that thought yes corona is a pandemic right now and we really should concentrate on helping others getting through this situation and keeping the infected as small as possible but without trying to be sadonic i believe maybe this virus is exact what we need right now just hear me out on this the amount of traffic in our cities is reduced by air flights are nearly shut down venice has now dolphins again air quality in italy and china increased drastically there is no smog over the cities the water is finally clear after years people are using bikes now more often home office is a thing now people are caring more for others it could lead to underpayed crisis jobs like nurses and cashiers get better payment people have the time to reflect themselves amp x b so yes we have to solve this pandemic and we need a way to live with it especially families and elderly people need a solution but i think the consequences corona gives us are good and maybe we should continue these things after the pandemic corona did way more for climate change than the politics of the last ten years continuing on this trend we could reach the co goals to prevent climate to collapse even more so i hope this crisis could also be an opportunity so could corona be a good thing right now or am i just mumbling,could corona be a good thing right now
1,since the start of march in australia it has been effectively impossible to get toilet paper due to covid until now i never realised how much of a bog roll bandit i am using up far too many rolls of toilet paper each week prior to covid hit us my fiancee and i are now both working from home in our apartment given the impossibility of buying toilet paper to make our remaining stocks last i have resorted to using the stand up bidet that is having a short shower after each session in the defecation station is everyone else who is isolating at home and staying at home doing the same thing or is everyone seriously using all the toilet paper they are hoarding,given how hard toilet paper is to get at the moment due to covid has caused has everyone else just resorted to using the stand up bidet as well
1,recently i ve been reading a lot about these paranormal experiences that turned out to be hallucinations cased by carbon monoxide like for example i read about this guy who kept seeing a ghost of a woman in her early to mid s in their house at night and was terrified by it but then they bought a carbon monoxide detector and it turned out that the paranormal sightings were just hallucinations caused by a carbon monoxide leak in the house you can probably tell where this is going based on the title and the subreddit by now but here goes would it be possible to purposefully create these hallucinations by releasing carbon monoxide into your house and then have sex with the hallucination of a ghost girl i ve heard of people having hallucinations where it felt like they could physically touch the hallucination so i guess in theory it would be possible right i m sorry i know this is probably a lot to take in and it sounds really fucked up but i m just beyond desperate i m a bit of a forever alone incel and i think this is the only way i ll ever be able to lose my virginity i don t hate women or anything i m just not the best looking guy i have a boring personality and my social skills are beyond shit i wouldn t mind being forced to haunt an old attic for all eternity if it just meant i d no longer be a virgin no matter how bad the sex i just want to get rid of this humiliating label second question if it were possible to do this would you genuinely consider it losing your virginity i know at first the obvious answer seems to be no but i want you to think about it more deeply than that why would your empirical experiences be more real than mine according to george berkeley s metaphysics existing is the same as being observed so if i experience an observation of the ghost then they d really exist in my subjective reality but not real in your subjective reality right so if i understood berkeley s philosophy correctly i d no longer be a virgin in my subjective reality what do you think last of all i know this post seems like some absurd troll and the fact that it s april fools day doesn t really help but i swear i m being sincere and that this isn t a troll despite it being quite absurd i m just really desperate to lose my virginity and will do anything i can to get rid of it at this point it s embarrassing as hell to still be a virgin at this age so please tell me your honest opinion instead of just assuming that nobody can be this desperate because believe it or not yes i really am this desperate,nsfw is it possible to have sex with a carbon monoxide hallucination if yes would this even count as losing your virginity

1,some background i have anxiety and a nearly crippling fear of death it s worst at night as i m left alone with my thoughts more and my boyfriend is asleep and so not able to calm me down when i start panicking but overall hearing about or seeing death mostly diseases and natural disasters is terrifying to me i also can t stand nihilism and pessimism i have a few friends who are nihilistic and whenever they start talking about that stuff i just panic and i can t seem to calm down until i either leave the conversation or they stop talking i know it s my anxiety that s making me so afraid of death it s pretty obvious lmao i don t want to fully stop being afraid after all a minimal amount of fear is good to keep yourself safe and cautious i just want that fear to stop plaguing my everyday thoughts and at least have me be able to talk to my friends normally and look at the news and my social media timeline without bordering on a panic attack every time so until i get enough money for a therapist are there any things i could do to relieve my stress,how do i stop being so afraid of death

1,i ve been thinking about this and decided to put a brave face on but not gonna lie i m nervous it s been heavy on my chest for a long time but after today it was the last straw might also be deleting this later background so my mom s sick almost every two weeks honestly it comes as no surprise whenever my sister tells me that our mom s feeling sick i just kind of shrug it off knowing that she ll feel better in a few days but then fall sick again i do pity her sometimes but at this point it s just one of those things almost like a tuesday it is exhausting having to deal with it but it isn t as bad as it can get i ve been struggling with finding the reason why she is sick though most of the time it s actual sicknesses but my mom had mentioned to me and my sister before that she is taking antidepressants because of us seems like she regrets having children it really did hurt us but we just took it without saying anything out of line she even had a mental breakdown and had let her tongue slip saying that we broke all her belongings when we were children children break things besides you chose to have us in the first place today i had finally snapped at one of my family members after they didn t want to help cleaning the house which my mom instructed us to do because she felt too sick naturally they run to my mom and she proceeded to yell at me saying things like my heart will stop right here i can do this on my own but then i ll die i was in the hospital because my heart is slowing down things like that essentially blaming me for what is happening to her or maybe i m just taking it like that and i cried after that incident i cried and it felt so painful having to listen to what she said but my immediate thought after she yelled at me was something very unpleasant and unsympathetic like i just wanted her to drop dead and stop yelling at me now that i think about it it actually freaks me out to think that some people don t have their mothers with them or have had the privilege of having a mother that loves them and i m over here hoping that the threat comes true i really do love her and i know she loves me despite threatening numerous times just packing up and leaving us in the dust plus dropping us off by an orphanage and living her best life well both my parents have threatened that before my parents gave up everything to be where they are today but i really don t think she s grateful for what she has sometimes there was a time when she treated my dad with disrespect and shattered everything in their room the reason why she did that was because she felt trapped not being able to work and that she had to leave her dream job to be with us and the most recent incident a few weeks back of her having an asthma attack and breaking almost every glass thing she owns am i really in the wrong for wishing she d just act on her threats as well as feeling indifferent towards them is this considered normal,is there something wrong with me

1,first post after just scrolling for about a year scary i ve never had someone properly counter this argument to me hear me out when overlooking sexual intercourse and genitalia which understandably varies across different genders i believe there are two fundamentals to liking someone romantically looks personality the same way in which a straight person could find someone of the opposite gender attractive they could find someone of the same gender attractive or even better looking than particular people of the opposite gender and before someone says they don t view people of the same gender attractive then how do you know if you yourself are attractive what do you compare to in that way the same applies to personality additionally i don t believe bisexuality is exactly an equal affinity or tendency to different genders more likely than not it would be a spectrum or slightly tilted weights on a scale and finally this argument is aside from environmental factors like religion upbringing etc with affects someone s beliefs on who they should be romantically inclined to this is more about primal innate desires or reception of different genders basically whats the difference between different genders that would stop one being bi,why isn t everyone bisexual or pansexual

1,this tara reade thing has blown up and at first i was really disappointed with biden until i looked a bit further into it apparently she was pro putin and wrote a lot about how great russia was and deleted her post when she came forward with this accusation also her initial accusation was that he touched her shoulders inappropriately in public which i believe but then all of a sudden she says he sexually assaulted her and fingered her against the wall i ve never seen sexual assault survivors change their story on what happened to them i mean sure christine blasey ford couldn t remember if there were or men holding her down but she never said he touched my breast over my shirt but a year later changed it to he held me down and raped me also if this was true i think it would have been so much more valuable to bring it into the news in may or june of when the field of candidates was much wider that way we could properly investigate the claim and the american people could decide fully informed if they wanted to vote for biden or not normally i believe women when it comes to sexual assault allegations but considering this involves a political campaign and russia tampered in our elections before what if they re trying this again what if they observed us for years and go hey they always believe the woman in rape accusations what if we get someone to accuse biden of rape so trump will get re elected i know it s crazy to think that and it s probably more likely biden sexually assaulted her but considering this came out when it was just between biden and bernie and not earlier it seems like an attempt to thwart our election problem is there s really no way to express this thought without saying you don t believe tara reade considering this is very different from other sexual assault cases weinstein or cosby weren t running for office or president and the facts of the russia thing i think it s reasonable to be skeptical but it feels like i m just turning into one of those dudes who automatically doubts women who come forward with sexual assault cases i really don t want to be that person but i also want to have an informed opinion and discuss this in a way that reflects all the facts,is there a way of believing women with sexual assault charges while also investigating them
