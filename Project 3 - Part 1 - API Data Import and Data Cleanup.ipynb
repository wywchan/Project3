       "Like I don't think I need to tell you how many weird fetishes exist... and in comparison to stuff like reddit's favourite example r/sounding (VERY NSFW, it's stuff inserted into penises) it's even pretty tame. I just don't care about other people's fetishes, so why are people so obsessed over it to the point that they hate people who say they're into it? I know this sounds as a justification, no, I'm not into this fetish. I'm just not against it?  \\n\\n\\nOf course there's the iDubbbz situation that's mostly more evident right now, but that's not only it.\\n\\nLike another example I can think of is Hentai, I read it some times just to change things up, and people hate the Netorare genre (cuckold) so much they'll leave negative comments on a porn site on purpose. Like old youtube.  \\n\\n\\nAnd it's different from insulting someone as a cuckold, because that's an insult that \"makes sense\" (as much as an insult can make sense), because it's seen as emasculating kinda like calling someone gay, also an insult.

       "(M20) Why can’t I reach ejaculation when I masturbate?\\n\\nIf there is a better sub to post this in please direct me there.\\n\\nI am a 20 yr old male, a virgin, and coming from a religious household where sex and masturbation were never discussed, I’ve only recently began masturbating within the past few years. \\n\\nThe issue I am facing is that I am unable to reach ejaculation when I masturbate. I tend to release a lot of clear pre ejaculate but the climax never comes. Sometimes I will begin to feel a stinging sensation and I will often have to stop and wait for it to die down. If my erection lasts for a long time I also tend to get pain in my testicles the next day (blue balls) which is pretty uncomfortable. \\n\\nI don’t know if it is something I am doing wrong or if there is something medically wrong that I should have checked out. I have a moderate sex drive and find things sexually attractive, and have also had wet dreams where i believe I have ejaculated from but I can’t seem to do it during masturbation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
       "Do people think face masks will protect them from the virus or are they are sick and they are blocking their own germs from infecting others? \\n\\nI lived in a few asian countries a few years ago and was told people wear masks when they are sick and want to be considerate to strangers and not cough and sneeze all over the place (was also a fashion trend for some kids). I also looked up online that the masks dont do very much to protect you from illness.\\n\\nLiving abroad has caused me to automatically not want to go near people who are wearing masks because I assume they are sick and being courteous. But under today's circumstances if you suspect you are sick you need to be home.\\n\\nAnd a related question:\\nWhy are people wearing gloves to do every single activity? It defeats the purpose of wearing gloves! For example, if you wear gloves in the store, push a grocery cart, touch groceries, make a phonecall, then touch your car door, steering wheel, seat belt, house door knob, all while wearing the same pair of gloves, you just caught corona if the virus was anywhere your gloves touched. Just wash your hands in between activities and every time you enter your home.\\n\\nAlso stop throwing your dirty ass masks and gloves all over the ground.       1\n",

       "To start off with, I'll try not to have any political bias in this post, either towards or against Trump. What I wanted to know is why it seems like so many people dislike him.\\n\\nI can't deny Trump has said some dumb or \"uninformed\" things in the past, but hasn't everyone? Is this held against him because there's a different standard for the US president? I feel like, while he says and does stupid stuff, he has helped at least some. Trump obviously isn't comparable to some former presidents, but I wouldn't call him the worst.\\n\\nI feel like Trump has helped. I can't state many examples for either side because I haven't followed politics in a while, but didn't he help with the economy? If I remember correctly, Hillary won the popular vote, so would she have been better?\\n\\nWith that said, I know this may not have been written very well, but I would like some feedback.
